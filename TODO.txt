TODO:
- Create a Trader class
  Spawn one market per Trader in a new process

- Send email when trade filled
- Write trend params (ATR coeff, gearing factor...) so that you dont have to calculate it all over everytime you run model live
DONE Allow selling of one currency if algo already holds some of it. If model wants to go from Long to Short, flatten the position.
DONE Continuously update positions.csv (separate thread?)
DONE Create and continuously update PnL spreadsheet (separate thread?)
- Create a Trade History spreadsheet
- Allow the algo to run without downloading all the historical data each time
- Apply gearing at the portfolio level
- Tidying up code



Ideas:
- Intraday trend following
- Arbitrage between exchanges
- Market Making on one exchange
